# Java_DSA_Learning

## Here I will upload/commit all the self-implemented Data Structures in Java

The goal behind all of this is to implement and learn all the DATA STRUCTURE using Built-in functions to learn the code behind the functionalities.

PS. I am a noobie to Java so learning by doing will be a better approach for me.
